Kayelitsha is a field of shacks, the second largest South African township, and the one which has grown the most in the past few years. It has reached more than 500thousand inhabitants, 50% of whom are under nineteen. New houses are eating up the last free areas of land, tin huts have arrived at the beach, up to the dunes that mark the only compulsory boundary of this township right at the gates of Cape Town.
                    <br> Phumeza Tisile is walking, hands in her pockets, a woollen hat on her head, and the straight look of someone who has already gone through a very harsh trial at only 25 years of age. Phumeza was born, and still lives, here in Kayelitsha, and has managed to defeat a killer that cannot yet be seen, heard, nor is in the headlines, especially in the West. A killer that still today condemns 1.5 million people around the world every year, 95% of whom are in the developing countries, and which is the first cause of death here in South Africa. Especially amongst the weaker population groups, those who live in the suburbs of the cities, in those bundles of precarious housing built in filth. Whole families crammed into a few square metres, where the air does not move and bacteria proliferate. That is exactly how South African townships are, despite the 2012 Football World Cup, despite the economic growth of the country, and despite the new middle class boom. In this kind of environment, which represents everyday life in places like Kayelitsha, TB continues to claim victims.

                «In 2010 I was diagnosed with TB. I started to take the recommended medicines but my body would not respond to them, the medicines had no effect on me – says Phumeza in her garden. After several analyses they told me I did not have ordinary Drug Susceptible TB but the MDR-TB (Multi Drug Resistant) type». This is another form of the disease, which is much more dangerous and created by genetic mutations of the bacteria caused by the incorrect assumption of medicines or by interrupted cures. It is, therefore, resistant to the usual drugs against TB, the ones commonly called “first line treatment”. This is a form of tuberculosis requiring a two-year cure, and the assumption of more or less 14,600 pills and hundreds of injections. A very expensive and painful treatment, not without health risks. «During the treatment period, I felt really bad, I vomited and felt sick all the time, I couldn’t eat, and I slowly lost my hearing. – Phumeza goes on – Until I became completely deaf. But these cures did not have the expected effect, and after more analyses, they told me I was XDR-TB (Extensively Drug Resistant) positive». A form of TB even more dangerous, even more resistant to the traditional medicines administered for this infection. Only with the help of the ONG Médicins Sans Frontières, Phumeza managed finally to receive the Linezolid treatment, a remedy that is very difficult to find in South Africa because of its high cost. In August 2013 she was negative to the tests, but her hearing was still lost. This year she had the chance to have two cochlear implants, and she managed to get her hearing back, along with her speech, finally being able to communicate with others again.

                Phumeza managed to get over it, but in South Africa, there are many – too many - who get sick and die every year, because of this silent killer, which is just everywhere. More or less 90,000 people every year, which means 10 people every hour. Because it is very easy to catch TB. In the minibuses that function as public transport for the majority of the people, in public spaces, in churches, in bars, in houses, all one needs is one cough, then with poor ventilation and at close range, the bacteria can spread. From the WHO data – it would appear that normal Drug Susceptible TB is slightly diminishing, but the situation related to the resistant forms of tuberculosis, both MDR and XDR, is very worrying. Different types of tuberculosis that have very expensive treatments and consume a great amount of the south African budget available for the cure of this disease. If the treatment for the common TB costs around 250$, the one for the MDR-TB sums up to something like 6,700$, while the XDR-TB is 26,392$ and that is one hundred times more expensive. According to Florian Von Groote, doctor and researcher of Task Applied Science, a research laboratory for anti-tuberculosis medicines, situated in Cape Town, «In the city alone there are more or less two thousand new cases of Drug Resistant TB every year, data which seems to be increasing rapidly. On one side because the frequency and accuracy of tests is improving, thanks to the use of, for instance, Genexpert that reduces diagnostic times, and on the other because not all patients managed to support the treatments, which are long and painful. This is why we are working on a series of medicines that could reduce the treatment to only six months instead of the actual 24 months».

                The cases of MDR-TB in South Africa have risen every year, from two thousand in 2005 to ten thousand in 2013, with a peak of fifteen thousand new infections in 2012, whilst in Western Cape Province, the worst affected one, Tuberculosis in all its forms, infects forty-five thousand people every year. And the chances of survival, for those affected by the drug resistant forms, are still very low: the treatments for the XDR-TB, according to a study lead by the WHO, are successful in 15% of the cases. This is also because of the shortage of medical structures: patients are treated and followed by their community doctors, and very few of them are actually moved to hospital, such as the Brooklyn Chest Hospital, a few kilometres away from the centre of Cape Town. Here, sick people live confined to a hospital wing which is divided according to the gravity of their condition. Men and women, young and old, walk the corridors with their faces covered by masks, to avoid spreading the bacteria. These masks have become an identifying mark for those who have caught TB: indispensable to prevent contagion, unbearable both because uncomfortable and most of all because they attract other people’s attention.
                <br> Right behind one of those masks, with a faint voice and clouded eyes, constantly coughing, Sive Mapeitu, 27 years old, diagnosed with MDR-TB tells us what is like to be under treatment: «I am always tired, injections are painful, I vomit a lot, I can’t walk for more than a few metres. I started the cure a few months ago and knowing I have to go on for almost two years really depresses me. All of this without even being sure of getting better, risking that the disease becomes more and more drug-resistant». Sive is, well was, a healthcare worker, before she got sick. «I am sure I was infected while working in Guguletu, a township in Cape Town where I used to live and where I spent all day with infected people – she continues – a filthy environment, twenty people using the same bathroom, no sewers, so of course TB proliferates». But most of all, what is missing, according to Sive, is information «People know little or nothing about the new forms of Tuberculosis, do not know how to prevent it, do not understand why the masks are necessary. The majority of people, if they start to cough, they just cure themselves as if they had caught a cold, and if the cough goes on, they pretend they’re fine, very few of them decide, of their own free will, to go and take the test ».

                Disinformation, certainly, but there’s fear, too. Fear of meeting your neighbours on the way to the hospital, fear of having to say to your family that you are TB positive, fear of being left alone, put aside by family and community. In South Africa, in 2015, the TB stigma is still very strong. «When two years ago I discovered I was TB positive, and a little later HIV positive, too, my family disappeared – says Moses Michize, 42 years old, MDR-TB positive, in front of his wooden shack in the Clare Estates township, near Durban. One day I had to go to a ceremony with my relatives. I just got the news that I had TB. I was tired and very sad, and so I told my mother. I have not heard from them since, not a phone call, not a visit for the entire treatment period. I no longer exist to them». Therefore, to avoid social isolation, it is better to hide one’s disease. This is how TB, just like HIV, continues to spread, especially in poor areas, in the most devastated outskirts. Stigma kills just like diseases do.
                <br/> “The Terrible Twins”, is how doctors and professionals over here call Tuberculosis and HIV. Too often they walk together. 70% of those with TB are also HIV positive. That is a huge number. Two out of three people are doubly infected and the nucleus of these epidemics, for which South Africa is concerned, seems to be the Kwazulu Natal province, where 39% of pregnant women are HIV positive, whereas the national average is about 29%. It is not a coincidence, then, that in the hospital of KingDinuZulu of Durban, one of the few paediatric departments was created, entirely dedicated to children affected by tuberculosis, where eight out of ten are also HIV positive. The director is Dr. Baboo Sunkarie, who has seen first-hand over the years how tuberculosis and its more resistant forms evolved. «In 2006, out of 32 beds only 4 were occupied by children affected by drug resistant TB, both MDR and XDR. Now there is not one child who has not been infected by one these forms of TB. We are noticing more and more how TB and HIV go hand in hand and develop in the same direction». According to Dr. Sunkarie, this depends mostly on the environment in which children are forced to grow up and by their living conditions «The majority of the children now in the ward come from tough social environments, from poor areas, where 6 or 7 people sleep in the same room, where sexual precautions are not used and hygiene in general is very low. This is how the bacteria spreads, and this is why the children on this ward – 90% of whom were born to HIV positive mothers – even if they successfully defeat TB, once they get home they are infected again».

                Children, adults, men, women, black, white, TB even more than HIV, couldn’t care less. The reason is quite simple: as it is airborne, anyone can breathe it in. Ivan Ross, a 61 year old fisherman, caught it, and from his small wood-shack on the top of a hill, he tells us he got sick in the hold of a fishing boat, as well as a white woman from a very rich part of the city of Cape town, Somerset West: Dalene Von Delft, a 33 year old doctor, infected because of her job which takes her really close to sick patients. But there is a community in South Africa, which more than others, historically, has had to deal with this disease, and nowadays with its more resistant forms. They are the South African miners, the backbone of South African industry. For centuries TB has affected miners more than any other workers, and the spread of MDR–TB and XDR-TB is putting even more at risk the life of tens of thousands people. One has to just step out of Johannesburg and go into the stretch of bare hills in this region, just for a few kilometres, to understand how mines are a fundamental and integral part of the South African economy. Carletonville and Westonaria, are only two of the towns where mines represent the nucleus of every sort of activity. Here, among the petrol stations, a group of restaurants and the stretches of houses built for the miners, Tuberculosis continues to claim victims, despite the commitments made by mining companies to guarantee security and the health of the workers. «The basic problem is that mines are, I dare to say, an environment worse than hell itself. Temperatures reach 35-38°C, the air is stagnant, there is no ventilation whatsoever and dust gets into the lungs. And when miners breath silica dust, they are exposed to great risks to their health» explains Georgina Jephson, a lawyer in Johannesburg, who, together with the Richard Spoor Law Office, is committed to defending thousands of miners, in a trial against thirty of the major mining companies of South Africa. This is the biggest trial ever attempted against the mining companies, asking for justice, compensation and healthcare for the miners, who, because of their working conditions, suffer from silicosis. «According to recent studies, one miner in four has got silicosis, and this is the first step towards Tuberculosis». Georgina Jephson continues «The mining companies, especially, those concerned with gold extraction, are not doing enough to protect miners’ health, and the latter are forced to keep up with backbreaking shifts, without the necessary protection».

                Twelve to fourteen hours in asphyxiating heat that makes their overalls stick to their skin. The thick air is difficult to breathe, dust rises at every explosion, the darkness obscures their sight: this is what the life of a miner is made of. Often the explosions are the main origin of the lung conditions that affect the majority of those miners. «I am sure that I got sick in the mine, –Tembe Djais tells us from his home in a small village at the gates of Bizana, in Eastern Province – I was team leader down in the mine, I had control over all the explosions. I was the first to go into the newly opened corridors, and first to breathe the dust before it even touched the ground. I decided to get involved in the trial against the mining companies because as soon as I retired I started to suffer from strong pains in my chest, breathing became difficult and I was coughing constantly. I got extremely thin, I couldn’t eat and I was diagnosed as TB positive. Luckily it was the Drug Susceptible one, and not one of the drug resistant types».

                Despite it being the number one killer in South Africa and the second worldwide, after HIV, due to one single infective agent, according to researchers, doctors, professors and healthcare workers, Tuberculosis does not get the necessary attention or the necessary investments from International donors, and above all, from the pharmaceutical companies. The latter are abandoning, one by one, the investments for research on Tuberculosis, for a more general re-routing of resources towards chronic conditions more than infectious ones. «The explanation is quite simple: the research on TB does not make enough profit – claims Nesri Padtayachi, member of the Caprisa ONG – Moreover, in Western countries, it is looked upon disease of the Third World, of poor people, whereas HIV, according to individual behaviour, is considered a major danger». It is the private sector that is leaving Tuberculosis aside. It is enough to read the names of the companies that have decided to move their resources somewhere else, in the last few years, to find confirmation: Pfizer left in 2012, AstraZeneca in 2013, Novartis in 2014. And it is not a coincidence that the private sector investments in TB researches have diminished by 11.8% between 2012 and 2013, and by a third from 2011 up to today. At this rate, if governments do not intervene first-hand and fill the gap left by the public sector, it will be extremely difficult to reach the one of the targets agreed by the Sustainable Development Goals: to defeat Tuberculosis by 2030. An epidemic which technically though does not exist, according to the director of the Tuberculosis program at WHO, the Italian Mauro Raviglione, because this disease «has become endemic by now, it has found its balance amongst the people, and this makes it even harder to defeat without investing in research».
